SchoolHELP is a system that has been proposed to allow schools to request for help from the general public. The schools may schedule tutorials for students who need remedial education, or request for resources such as mobile devices, network routers or personal computers. Volunteers can then check SchoolHELP for requests and make an offer to volunteer for any requests that they can fulfill, for example to help out in a tutorial or donate digital devices.
